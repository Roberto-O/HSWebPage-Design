  <h1>Keeping The City Clean and Safe</h1>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>If I were to be elected as State Governor would always make sure to keep the city as clean and as safe as possible. I would always have people making sure that there is no trash on the ground near our parks and our schools. Also if anyone is caught littering action will be taken. I willl also try to completely remove any illegal groups from our city.<img src="images/clean streets.jpg" alt="clean streets" width="250" height="292" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="right" /></h3>
<h3><img src="images/listening.jpg" alt="listening" width="180" height="178" vpsace="20"  hspace="20" align="left" />Another thing i will do is listen to the towns people (you) to try to satisfy you as much as i can. If you have any concerns or wants something added to our city, like a new park, playground, school, or building i can make it happen.</h3>
