<h2><font color="white">Biography</font></h2>
<h4><font color="white">Jesse Eisenberg was born on October 5, 1983, in the Queens borough of New York City, to Barry and Amy Eisenberg. Eisenberg's father was a sociology professor, and his mother occasionally entertained as a clown at children's parties. Eisenberg and his two sisters, Hallie Kate and Kerri, were raised in the suburb of East Brunswick, New Jersey.</font></h4>
<h4><font color="white">Eisenberg became interested in acting at an early age. When he was 7, he starred as Oliver Twist in a children's theater production of the musical <em>Oliver!</em>and at the age of 13 he was an understudy in a Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams' <em>Summer and Smoke</em>.</font></h4>
<h4><font color="white">Eisenberg attended East Brunswick High School in New Jersey before transferring to the High School of Performing Arts in New York. When he was a senior he received a breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film <em>Roger Dodger</em>, cast alongside Campbell Scott, Isabella Rossellini and Jennifer Beals.</font></h4>
<h4><font color="white">Eisenberg attended college at The New School in New York and continued to act in a range of movies. He had a small role in M. Night Shyamalan's <em>The Village</em> in 2004. He attracted favorable reviews for his performance in 2005's well-received indie drama <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>, in which he played a bright, awkward teenager coming of age in 1980s Brooklyn while coping with the divorce of his parents, played by Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney. In 2007 he appeared in <em>The Hunting Party</em> (a drama set in Bosnia) and <em>The Education of Charlie Banks</em>. 2009 was another busy year: He co-starred with Kristen Stewart in the witty teen comedy-drama <em>Adventureland</em>, and with Woody Harrelson in the apocalyptic farce <em>Zombieland</em>.</font></h4>
