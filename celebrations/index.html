<h4 align="left">The School has decided to celebrate its 20 year anniversary of  teaching kids on how to be a better person for tomorrow by educating them and teaching them good manners. Because of this we, the school board, have decided to celebrate by having a trip to Japan! Here kids will learn traditional japanese dances that will teach students of Japanese culture. We will also be sight seeing around the city and be visiting many historical landmarks. And dont worry about your kid not eating. Every day we will visit one of a kind Japanese restaurants. On the last day we will go on a boat around the city during the night like the picture. Your kid can attend this trip by paing a small fee of $2,000. We will provide everything they need. We hope to see you soon! <a href="destinations.html">Destinations</a></h4>
