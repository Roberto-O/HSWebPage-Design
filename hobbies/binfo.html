</h1>
<p>Baking refers to two culinary processes: cooking by dry heat in an enclosed oven and making up flour-based goods (breads, cakes, pastries) that are cooked by baking. By extension a baking day is devoted to making breads and cakes and includes the idea of a batch bake or tray bake made up in quantity for cutting into smaller pieces. Cooking flour-based items using a griddle is also considered a form of baking. &quot;Roasting&quot; meat or vegetables such as potatoes in the oven is also in practice baking. The idea is also implied in the clambake of shellfish, using layers of heated stones and seaweed.</p>
<p>Two trades are directly concerned with baking, the baker using yeast to make breads and the pastry cook producing delicate pastries and cakes. The demarcation is unclear in English, which often applies the word &quot;baker&quot; to someone who makes cakes. French distinguishes more sharply between the <em>boulanger</em> and the<em>pâtissier,</em> as does German between the <em>Backer </em>and the <em>Konditor.</em></p>
<p>The technique has a wide geographical spread. It is used throughout North America and Europe, across the Middle East and North Africa, and into central Asia and northern India. The concept was introduced by Europeans to their former colonies, many of whom have continued the practice. Baking is exceptionally important in cultures that rely on wheat as their primary cereal. Methods and technology have developed principally to exploit and enhance the properties of the gluten it contains. Others (rye, barley, oats) contain less gluten but are used in northern and western European baking, usually as residual traditions from times when wheat was expensive and difficult to obtain. Maize does not lend itself to baking, although North American settlers managed to develop corn breads, and the Atlantic communities of northern Portugal and Spain also use it in breads and cakes.<a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/food_editorials/pastry/baking_tips/baking_information_for_beginner_chefs.html"><img src="images/wfri.jpg" alt="with friends" width="250" height="177" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The history of baking is one of interaction between ingredients, fuels, and oven technology. On a basic level virtually any food can be &quot;baked&quot; by burying it in hot ashes or placing it on a stone beside the fire, something that must have been known from the earliest times. Developing control to the point of producing items as diverse as breakfast rolls, soufflés, and chocolate brownies has taken thousands of years.</p>
