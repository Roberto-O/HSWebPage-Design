<img src="imgaes/pumpkin.jpg" alt="pumpkin" width="210" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Halloween is known for going outside and visiting different houses gathering different types of candy <img src="imgaes/Candy.jpg" alt="candy" width="210" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />to eat once you return home. You also get to put on a costume of your chossing to pretend to be that person you always wished you could be. Another fun activity you can do with your family tis carve pumpkins and make Jack o Lanterns! This especially can be very fun and excuting becuase you get to create all sorts of cool designs. It can be scary or not, no matter what you carve it will look awesome at the end! One last activity you can do, maybe with your friends or family, is to go to a hunted house. It can either be a professional one or you can just come to the one that I am creating at my house. Everyone in the town is invited. Once you finish doing your trick or treating come by, but be prepared to be scared!</h3>
