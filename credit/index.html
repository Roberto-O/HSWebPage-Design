<p>A credit card can be a great<a href="questions.htm"> financial tool</a>, but it also is  a big responsibility. Applying for and receiving a credit card generally is an  easy procedure. Offer from credit card companies arrive frequently in the  regular mail.</p>
<p>Many people, particularly first-time users, do not fully  understand the implications of a credit card. They may charge more than they  can repay. This can damage a credit rating and create credit problems that can  be difficult to fix. <a href="theft.htm">Credit card and identity theft can be a major issue when applying for credit.</a></p>
<p>Before you submit a credit application, obtain a copy of  your credit report from one of the three major credit reporting agencies to  make sure it is accurate. The <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction (FACT) </a>Act  allows consumers in the United States to receive one free copy of their credit  report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies during a  twelve-month period.</p>
