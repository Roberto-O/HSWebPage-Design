<ol >
  <li><b>What kind of credit card should I get? </b><br>
    Consider how you will use the card. Do you pay the entire balance at the end 
    of every month? Or, do you make minimum payments? For those individuals who 
    pay the entire balance each month, interest rate is not a priority. Most likely, 
    you will not have to pay finance charges. Instead, look for a company that 
    does not charge an annual fee. If you tend to carry an outstanding balance, 
    search for a card issuer that charges very low interest rates.<br>

  <li><b>Should I get credit disability insurance?<br>
    </b>Credit disability insurance pays off your credit card bills if you become 
    unable to work. Many credit card and direct mail companies offer this type 
    of insurance. The insurance is generally very expensive. If you are in good 
    health, a broader policy would probably be a better option. </li>

  <li><b>What is the Fair Credit Billing Act? </b><img src="images/question.jpg" alt="Questions?" width="149" height="320" align="right"><br>
    The<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre16.shtm"> Fair Credit Billing Act</a> </a>is a federal law that determines how billing errors 
    and disputes involving credit and charge cards are handled. If you check the 
    back of your monthly statement, generally you will find information about 
    this process. If the company violates any provision of the law, you can sue 
    to recover any damages. </li>
